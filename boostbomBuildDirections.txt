from the main boost repo directory:
>cd boost-jaxrs

edit pom.xml:

change pom <version> tag to:
<version>0.7-SNAPSHOT</version>

in dependencyManagement block, 
change jax-rs <artifactId> tag to:
<artifactId>jaxrs-2.0</artifactId>

save and exit edit session

>mvn clean install

Once that maven build finishes, re-edit the pom.xml:
change pom <version> tag to:
<version>0.8-SNAPSHOT</version>

in dependencyManagement block, 
change jax-rs <artifactId> tag to:
<artifactId>jaxrs-2.1</artifactId>

save and exit edit session 

>mvn clean install

once that maven build finishes, cd back to main boost repo dir and run the project build:

>cd ..
>mvn clean install

the jax-rs it is using the ee7 bom and a generic boost-jaxrs dependency which should now result in jaxrs-2.0 being downloaded and used for compile.
